				<h2>How to find us!</h2>
					<p>Map Location:</p>
					<p>Atlantic's Best B&B sits upon Sea View Street, just a 20-minute drive from the Square, Clifden Town Centre. About 20 steps out our front door, the road branches left to the Beach Road, to Clifden Quay and the Boat Club, and to the right begins the breathtaking and aptly named Sky Road, with on-foot access to the Darcy Monument and Clifden Castle.</p>
					<p>Clifden Town, “Capital of Connemara”, sprawls across 2 drumlin hills overlooking Clifden Bay, with magnificent views of the indigo and violet-soaked Twelve Bens from nearly everywhere in town.</p>
					<p>The city of Westport, in Co. Mayo, lies 65 km (40 miles) to the northeast of Clifden with Galway City just 81km (50 miles) to the southeast of Clifden. The newly opened <strong>M6</strong> means Clifden, though remote in its quiet location on the very edge of Europe, is less than a 3-hour drive from Dublin.</p>

					<h2>Getting Here</h2>
					<p>Take the N59 northwest from Galway City or southwest from Westport.</p>
					<p>From the N59, enter Clifden’s one-way traffic loop to Bridge Street, Market Street, and at the Square (obelisk metal monument in front of E.J. King’s) turn left past SuperValu and we’ll be on the right hand side, 30 metres (100ft) past the Bank of Ireland. Look for our stone façade covered in clematis vines and roses, the flowers spilling out of our garden, and the <b>Atlantic's Best B&B</b> sign.</p>
